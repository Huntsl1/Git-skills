    <h1>Stephen L. Hunt</h1>
      <p>I grew up here in Greenville, and I've lived in Charleston, Charlotte, and Los Angeles. I got into code by accident.  I was managing at Caviar and Bananas and kept
      seeing all of these people with TIY t-shirts and started asking questions.  My first thought
      was, "these people sure aren't very buff to be working at a gym!" I felt that I was well into
      my culinary and wine career, and I joined codecademy and team treehouse and I couldn't get coding
      out of my head.  The rest is history.</p>
